Most people pick one lane. I've spent 30 years refusing to.

- I taught myself HTML at 15 in 1995 when the web was tables and `<font>` tags. 
- Built e-commerce platforms at Burlington before most companies knew what e-commerce was. 
- Learned modern frameworks (Angular, Blazor, Vue) by shipping production code in healthcare and pharma. 
- Built design systems that were technology agnostic 
- Got SVPG training and Product Manager certification because designing without product thinking is just pushing pixels.

Here's what I've learned: The hard part isn't building product. It's building product *culture*. I watched talented engineers trapped in "build what they ask for" mode, shipping features nobody uses. The difference wasn't talent—it was permission to think like product people.

I specialize in the messy intersection of product strategy, design systems, and engineering velocity. 
- I embed workflows where users actually work. 
- I transform order-taking IT departments into empowered teams. 
- I implement product/behavioral analytics so teams make insight-driven decisions instead of building what shouts loudest.

I don't have a computer science degree. I have 30 years of shipping products that solve real problems in complex industries where the stakes are high and "move fast and break things" isn't an option.
