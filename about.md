Most people pick one lane. I've spent 30 years refusing to.

## The Journey

- Taught myself HTML at 15 in 1995 when the web was tables and `<font>` tags
- Built e-commerce platforms at Burlington before most companies knew what e-commerce was
- Learned modern frameworks (Angular, Blazor, Vue) by shipping production code in healthcare and pharma
- Built design systems that work across any technology stack
- Got SVPG training and Product Manager certification because designing without product thinking is just pushing pixels

## What I Actually Do

**I write code.** Not just prototypes — production code. I built an AI chatbot with RAG architecture over a weekend. I create CI/CD pipelines for design systems. I ship features in Angular, Vue, and Blazor. When I say "this will take two sprints," I know because I've done it.

**I run discovery.** I've sat with analysts watching them print digital reports and mark them up with red pens. I've deployed Pendo polls that revealed $1.2M in avoided waste. I interview users, map experiences, and find the problems nobody asked about.

**I design systems.** Not just pretty mockups—living design systems with documentation, version control, and copy-paste implementation guides. Technology-agnostic foundations that work whether the team uses React, Angular, or Blazor.

**I transform culture.** I've watched talented engineers trapped in "build what they ask for" mode, shipping features nobody uses. The difference wasn't talent—it was permission to think like product people. I give teams that permission.

## Where I've Done It

- **Healthcare & Pharma** — Where compliance isn't optional and bad UX costs lives
- **Government** — Where you can't "move fast and break things"
- **Enterprise B2B SaaS** — Where complex workflows need elegant solutions
- **Retail & E-commerce** — Where I learned that every second of friction is lost revenue

## The Skills That Don't Fit in One Box
