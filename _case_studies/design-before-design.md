## The Problem

Starting with screens is ok, but we have to understand a few key things about what we're doing first. These simple questions will prevent mistakes that can lead to re-work hell&hellip;

<!--
## The Problem

A teammate was doing what designers are trained to do: she was carefully moving elements around in a wireframe tool, nudging boxes, aligning things, tweaking layouts.

She was wasting her time — and she knew it.

The wireframe wasn't the problem. The *medium* was. Low-fidelity wireframes told engineers almost nothing about what to expect next. Stakeholders couldn't interact with them. And any feedback they generated led to more wireframe revisions rather than actual alignment on what to build.

Meanwhile, a larger pattern was playing out across the team. We were running sprints without a picture of where we were going. A complex feature had been built so tightly coupled to the backend that a component stakeholders expected couldn't be added — not without significant rework. No one had visualized the full system before any part of it was built.

Agile was being used as a reason not to plan upfront. **Speed without direction isn't speed. It doubles your time.**

The team needed a way to show the whole before building any part of it — interactive, high-fidelity, and in the actual medium the product would live in.

## The Insight

The teammate's observation was the spark: she didn't need a *higher-fidelity design tool*. She needed to skip the design tool entirely.

Figma links, Axure exports, Adobe XD handoffs — every one of these is an abstraction layer between design intent and working code. Engineers receive a static reference and have to reinterpret it. Gaps in alignment surface in code review, not in the prototype. That's an expensive place to find them.

**We didn't need another tool. We needed a different paradigm.**

What if the prototype *was* the development artifact?

## What We Built

She brought the idea. I stood up the infrastructure.

We started a dedicated GitLab project for AI-generated prototypes, working in VSCode with both Gemini and GitLab Duo — the latter running on Anthropic models, which produced noticeably better code quality and component modernity than anything else we tested.

The output: interactive HTML prototypes. Stakeholders can actually open them in a browser and try them. Not click through a Figma frame — *use* them. The gap between "here's the design" and "here's what we're building" disappears when both are the same file.

We're now exploring a monorepo structure where each prototype lives as its own project within a project — using a shared standard framework, buildable and runnable independently. The goal is to hand engineers not a link to a design file, but actual components they can inspect, run, and adapt directly.

## The Results

The shift happened faster than expected.

- **Started designing a month earlier** than the team's normal timeline — going into discovery with interactive ideas instead of blank storyboards
- **Multiple options explored** for the first time — something the team never had bandwidth for with traditional wireframe tools
- **Engineering sentiment: entirely positive** — they can open the prototype, run it, and see real component behavior
- **Design team: immediate adoption** — the team was ready before we finished the first prototype
- **Stakeholder alignment improved** — interactive prototypes surface gaps in understanding that wireframes can't

## Key Takeaway

> The design handoff isn't a process problem. It's a medium problem. When your prototype lives in the same medium as your product, there's nothing left to hand off.

We didn't adopt a new design tool. We skipped the category entirely.

AI prototyping doesn't just accelerate design — it closes the gap between design and development by making them the same artifact. Designers work in the medium engineers work in. Stakeholders test what engineers will build. The translation layer that's been silently taxing teams for decades is gone.

The idea came from a designer who was tired of moving boxes. That's usually where the best insights come from.
