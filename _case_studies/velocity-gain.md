## This case study is in the works and will be ready soon...
<!--
## The Problem

Our development team was slowing down. Sprint after sprint, velocity was declining. Stories were taking longer than estimated, and developers were frustrated.

The issue? **Poor developer experience (DX)** in our own internal tools and codebase.

## The Insight

As a product leader who codes, I noticed something others might have missed:

- Developers were spending 40% of their time fighting **tooling and infrastructure**
- The component library was **inconsistent and poorly documented**
- Local development setup took **2-3 days** for new engineers
- Testing was **slow and unreliable**

**UX isn't just for end users—it's for developers too.**

## The Solution

I led a 6-week initiative to improve developer experience:

### 1. Component Library Overhaul
- Created a **comprehensive design system**
- Built **reusable, well-documented components**
- Added **interactive Storybook** for all components

### 2. Developer Tooling
- Streamlined local setup to **30 minutes**
- Implemented **fast feedback loops** (hot reload, quick tests)
- Added clear error messages and debugging tools

### 3. Documentation & Onboarding
- Created **video walkthroughs** of the codebase
- Built an **interactive CLI tool** for common tasks
- Documented architectural decisions and patterns

## The Results

Within 8 weeks of implementation:

- **30% increase in development velocity**
- New engineer onboarding time reduced from **3 days to 2 hours**
- Developer satisfaction scores increased from **5.2 to 8.7/10**
- Bug count decreased by **40%** (better DX = fewer mistakes)
- Time to production decreased by **25%**

## Key Takeaway

> Product thinking applies to everything you build—including internal tools. Invest in developer experience and you'll see returns across every metric that matters.

As a product leader who codes, I bridge the gap between user experience and developer experience. Both matter. Both deserve the same level of craft and care.
