## The Challenge

The executive team was convinced they needed a complex new feature set that would take a full development year and cost $1.2M. The pressure was on to start building immediately.

But something didn't feel right. The assumptions weren't validated, and the customer pain points weren't clearly articulated.

## The Approach

Instead of jumping straight into development, I advocated for a **two-week discovery sprint**:

- Conducted 20+ customer interviews
- Analyzed existing product usage data
- Mapped current workflows and pain points
- Prototyped three alternative solutions

## The Discovery

What we found changed everything:

- **The real problem** wasn't what executives thought it was
- Customers had a **workaround** they were already using
- A **simpler solution** could be delivered in 6 weeks, not 12 months
- The proposed feature would have **low adoption** based on actual user needs

## The Outcome

By investing two weeks in proper discovery:

- **Saved $1.2M** in unnecessary development costs
- Delivered a **better solution** in 1.5 months instead of 12
- Achieved **87% adoption rate** (vs. projected 30% for original plan)
- Built trust with stakeholders by showing evidence, not opinions

## Key Takeaway

> Evidence-based discovery isn't about slowing down—it's about making sure you're running in the right direction.

Sometimes the most valuable thing a product leader can do is **say "wait"** and **ask "why?"** before the team invests months building the wrong thing.
