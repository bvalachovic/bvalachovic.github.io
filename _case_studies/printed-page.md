## This case study is in the works and will be ready soon...

## The Request

"We need a better dashboard. Make it more visual, add charts, make it interactive."

The analytics team was frustrated with the current reporting system. They wanted a redesign with more bells and whistles.

## The Discovery

I decided to do something old-school: **watch them actually work.**

I sat with three analysts for a full day each, observing how they used the reports.

**What I discovered changed everything:**

Every single analyst did the same thing:
1. Opened the digital report
2. **Printed it out**
3. Marked it up with a **red pen**
4. **Never looked at the screen again**

The "dashboard problem" wasn't a dashboard problem at all.

## The Real Job to Be Done

Through contextual inquiry, I learned:

- Analysts needed to **compare data across time periods** side-by-side
- They needed to **annotate and share findings** with colleagues
- They worked on **two different reports simultaneously**
- The printed format was **easier to reference during phone calls**
- Digital navigation was **too slow for their workflow**

The job wasn't to "view data"—it was to **analyze, annotate, and communicate findings quickly.**

## The Solution

Instead of a fancier dashboard, we built:

### 1. Print-Optimized Layout
- Designed for **8.5x11" paper** from day one
- Two-column layout that **matches how they think**
- Clear section markers for quick reference

### 2. Comparison View
- **Side-by-side mode** for time period comparisons
- Difference highlighting built into the system
- Export to **annotatable PDF** with form fields

### 3. Collaborative Annotations
- **Digital markup tools** that felt like a red pen
- Share annotated reports with **comments intact**
- Version history of all annotations

### 4. Rapid Navigation
- **Keyboard shortcuts** for power users
- **Bookmarking** of frequently accessed sections
- **Quick filters** that preserved context

## The Results

- Report review time reduced by **40%**
- Analyst satisfaction increased from **4.1 to 9.2/10**
- Printing decreased by **60%** (those who wanted digital now had a real alternative)
- Collaboration efficiency improved by **35%**
- Onboarding time for new analysts cut by **50%**

## Key Takeaway

> The feature request is rarely the real problem. Watch people work. Understand the job they're trying to get done. Then design for that—not for what they say they want.

Sometimes the most valuable thing you can do is **ignore the stated requirements** and discover the actual need.

This is why I combine **product leadership with hands-on research**. Theory is cheap. Observation reveals truth.
