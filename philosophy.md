## Core Beliefs

Product leadership isn't about shipping features or following frameworks. It's about creating the conditions where great products emerge naturally—through trust, evidence, and relentless focus on what actually matters.

These beliefs have been forged over 30 years working in dysfunctional organizations, resistant cultures, and hostile environments. They're not theory. They're survival tools that became principles.

### Build Trust, Not Features
Everything starts with trust. Not user trust in your product—though that matters. I mean the trust between people building the product.
In dysfunctional organizations, trust is the scarcest resource. People hide mistakes, hoard information, and cover their asses instead of solving problems. The organization optimizes for not getting blamed instead of creating value.
My job isn't to ship features. It's to create environments where:

- "I don't know" is a strength, not a weakness
- People bring problems before they become crises
- Failure is data, not career-ending
- Disagreement is productive, not dangerous

When trust exists, everything else gets easier. Discovery becomes honest. Priorities become clear. Teams move fast because they're not navigating political minefields.

When trust doesn't exist, no framework or process will save you. You'll build the wrong things efficiently while talented people burn out or leave.
I've built trust-based subcultures inside toxic organizations. It's possible. It's slow. That's why it's important for trust to be built from the top.  It all starts with vulnerability.

### Evidence Over Assumptions

Most product failures don't happen because teams build the wrong solution. They happen because teams never questioned whether they were solving the right problem.
I've saved over $1.2 million by stopping projects that had no evidence to support them. Not because I'm smarter than anyone else—because I insisted on testing assumptions before committing resources.
Evidence-based product development means:

Discovery before delivery, always
Small bets to validate big ideas
User research that asks "should we?" not just "how should we?"
The willingness to hear "this is a bad idea" and act on it

The hardest part isn't finding evidence. It's building cultures where evidence is allowed to kill ideas people are attached to. Where "the data says no" overrides "the CEO really wants this."
I've watched organizations waste millions building features no one asked for, solving problems that don't exist, and optimizing metrics that don't matter—all because no one had permission to ask "but should we?"
Evidence gives you that permission. And the courage to use it.

### Outcomes Over Outputs

Feature factories are comfortable. You know what you're building. Roadmaps look impressive. Stakeholders get their requests. Everyone feels productive.
You're also probably building the wrong things.
Outcome-focused product development is uncomfortable. It requires:

Saying no to features that don't move the needle
Measuring what matters, not what's easy
Focusing deeply on problems, not solutions
Accepting that "we shipped nothing" might be the right answer

At the Senate, I drove a personnel system from paper workflows to 100% electronic submission by rejecting competing features and focusing on complete PeopleSoft integration. We could have shipped a dozen small features that made stakeholders happy.
Instead, we shipped one complete solution that eliminated 400+ hours of annual manual work. That's the difference between outputs and outcomes.
Outputs are what you ship. Outcomes are what changes.
Most organizations reward outputs because they're visible and predictable. Outcomes require patience, discipline, and the willingness to look unproductive while you validate whether what you're building actually matters.
I optimize for outcomes. Even when it makes me unpopular.
