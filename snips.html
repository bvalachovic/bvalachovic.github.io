                    Most people ask "what do you want?". I ask for your story, then deliver what you really need.<br /> 
                    While others build standalone features, I design integrated workflows.<br /> 
                    While others add another portal to the stack, I embed solutions where users already work.<br />
                    While others accept "order-taker" engineering culture, I transform teams from reactive to product-led.
